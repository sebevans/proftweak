--Important Note for MAC USERS--
If you get an error "proftweak.app is damaged and can't be opened" - it is due to your Gatekeeper settings requiring apps be signed.  See http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5290 for the solution.

If something isn't working for you - there's a decent chance it's addressed there.  If things still don't work for you - feel free to bug me.

ProfTweak is built with Processing 2.0.3 and G4P v3.3.  Building Proftweak with newer versions of Processing causes an issue launching from Makerware / Makerbot Desktop.
